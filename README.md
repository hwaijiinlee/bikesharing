# NYC Bike Sharing Data Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to showcase the success of NYC's bikesharing program so that we can learn from them and repeat the success in Des Moines

## Results
![Top Starting Locations](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Top_Starting_Locations.png)

The map shows the top starting locations of bikesharing users. The darker circles indicate a larger number of bikes being rented in that location. Tourists seem to be drawn to renting these bikes. Des Moines is a tourist attraction and is therefore an ideal place to start our very own bikesharing program.

![Checkout Times by Gender](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_Times_Gender.png)

The graph shows the length of time the bikes were rented out for by gender. Males tend to check the bikes out for longer periods of time than females but almost everybody checks the bikes out for less than one hour. 

![Trips by Gender](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Trips_Gender.png)

This heatmap shows the number of trips each gender takes the bikes out for and at what times of each day of the week. Once again, males tend to rent the bikes out in the mornings and evenings, presumably for commutes to and fro work and slightly longer in the evenings perhaps as part of their exercise routine on their way home from work.

![User Trips](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/User_Trips.png)

This heatmap shows the types of users who rents the bikes. Most of the users are subscribers which bodes well for Des Moines' program as that would mean a steady flow of income and unsurprisingly, male subscribers outnumber females subscribers.

![August Peak Hours](https://github.com/hwaijiinlee/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/August_Peak_Hours.png)

In our analysis, we noticed that August is the most popular month for renting out bikes in NYC. Des Moines might be slightly different with the different weather patterns. However, we can see at the height of the bike rental, as many as over 220,000 bikes are rented out! Evenings are the most popular time to rent these bikes out as well.

## Summary
In summary, it appears that there are more male bike users than females, and many of the male bike users seem to use the bikes for their commutes to work and perhaps their evening R&R as well. As long as Des Moines is bike friendly, we are confident that a similar usage pattern can be repeated here. In order to encourage females to also rent bikes, we can consider having some tandem bikes so that the females can ride along with their male friends/partners instead of having to rent their own bikes. 

In order to further analyse the bike sharing data, we can consider the following additional visualizations:
1) adding the gender to the color marks in the Average Trip Duration graph to clearly show the length of time each gender rents the bikes out for and by their ages in one visualization; and
2) adding the user type (i.e. customer or subscriber) in the August Peak Hours graph to the color mark to clearly show the differentiation.
